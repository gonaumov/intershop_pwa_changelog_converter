It looks like you're trying to parse a large Markdown file with Angular 2 migrations from 0.26 to 1.4.

Here's the output in JSON format:

```
{
"From": "0.26",
"To": "1.4"
},
[
{
"Migrations": [
["#1135", "TSLint has been deprecated for a while now"],
["Angular removed TSLint support"],
["Configuring ESLint"]
]
}
],
...
```

Please let me know what you'd like to do with this data.

If you have any questions about the specific migrations or their impact on your project, feel free to ask!
